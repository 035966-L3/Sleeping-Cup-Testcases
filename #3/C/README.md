### General instruction

The generator in this problem requires no input.

Please directly use `commands.bat` (Windows) / `commands.sh` (Linux) for generating.

Remember to run the command `chmod +x commands.sh` first if you are generating on Linux.

(In fact, we firstly generated twice to get 40 testcases and then discarded 20 of them by hand.)
