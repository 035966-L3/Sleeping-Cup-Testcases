Hello, there! This is the first sample.
Note that you should NOT ignore spaces or endlines.
This is Line 3. The letter 'L' is on Column 9. Have a count!
This line (Line 4) is somewhat special because... 
... there is a space at the end of the line.



Do you see anything? Yeah, Lines 6-8 are empty!
    And ... this line starts with 4 spaces!
            
Is Line 10 empty? No! There are 12 spaces.
The following 5 lines consist of a space each.
 
 
 
 
 
The last lines (Lines 20-21) is also empty. Good luck!
