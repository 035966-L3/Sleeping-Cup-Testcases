# Sleeping Cup's Testcases

## What is Sleeping Cup?

## Are there any other useful links?

Certainly: <https://github.com/035966-L3/Sleeping-Cup-Ratings>

## Why can't I find the data of problem X?

We only store the data of the problems from our contests. Subjective and objective problems are ignored because there is really nothing to store.

## What's the usage of `gen.cpp`?

You can use `gen.cpp` to generate data. The input of generators are given in the `gen_input.txt` file. If you have any problems on the usage of `gen.cpp`, you can contact us. Note that some testcases (especially the first ones) are handmade. A `README.md` file (instead of `gen.cpp`) will be provided if the data it generated requires manual modification.
