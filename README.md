# Sleeping Cup's Testcases

## What is Sleeping Cup?

## Are there any other useful links?

Certainly: <https://github.com/035966-L3/Sleeping-Cup-Ratings>

## Why can't I find the data of problem X?

We only store the data of the problems from our official contests. Subjective and objective problems are ignored because there is really nothing to store.

## How to use generators?

The names of generators will include the substring `gen`. You just need to compile these programs and run using the input given in the corresponding text file. Here are some examples:

- `gen.cpp` <- `gen_input.txt`
- `gen_default.cpp` <- `gen_input_default.txt`
- `gen_14.cpp` <- (this usually requires no input)

You can also contact us for any questions on the use of generators. However, you should check the `README.md` file and read it (if you found it) first. 

Note that some testcases (especially the first ones as samples) are handmade.
