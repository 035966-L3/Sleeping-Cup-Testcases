# Sleeping Cup's Testcases

## What is Sleeping Cup?

This one: <http://8.136.99.126/>

## Why can't I find XXX's data?

We store the data of only the problems with the prefix 'Contest' here. Subjective problems are ignored because there is really nothing to store.

## What's the usage of `gen.cpp`?

You can use `gen.cpp` to generate data. The command lines used while generating the testcases are not stored. However, if you have any problems on the usage of `gen.cpp`, you can contact us. Note that some testcases (especially the first ones) are handmade. Moreover, `gen.cpp` will be not provided if the data it generated requires manual modification.
