Tests 18-44 are generated manually.

We first generated two identical texts and then modified one of them by hand.

There are three types of identical texts:

- Type A: 1/95 probablity for non-linefeeds. No linefeeds.
- Type B: Linefeeds only. No other characters.
- Type C: 1/96 probablity for both linefeeds and non-linefeeds.
