**（注：本题标题为 `Conductor`）**

## 题目描述

A conductor refers to a __ubstance with low electrical resistivity that is easy to conduct electrical current. There are a __arge number of freely moving charged particles in a conductor called charge carriers. Under the action of an external electric fi__ld, charge carriers undergo directional motion, forming a significant curr__nt. Metal is the most common type of conductor. The outermost valence electrons of metal atoms can easily break free from the constraints of the atomic nucleus and become free electrons, leaving behind __ositive ions (atoms) that form a regular latt__ce. The concentration of free electrons in metals is high, so th conductivity of metal conductors is usually higher than that of other co__ductor materials. The resistivity of metal conductors __enerally decreases with de__reasing temperature. At extremely low temperat__res, the resistivity of certain metals and alloys will disappear and transform into "su__erconductors".
